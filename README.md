## What is ASIO ? ##
Audio Stream Input/Output (ASIO) is a computer sound card driver protocol for digital audio specified by Steinberg, providing a low-latency and high fidelity interface between a software application and a computer's sound card. Whereas Microsoft's DirectSound is commonly used as an intermediary signal path for non-professional users, ASIO allows musicians and sound engineers to access external hardware directly. (From [ASIO Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Stream_Input/Output) ).

## This plugin ##
* This project supersedes an earlier project co-developed with Andersama. The earlier project is now unmaintained.
* The new project does not rely on any third-party library but relies on the openasio SDK v2 (which is a subset of the original openasio SDK which we had written).
* What this plugin for [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) does:
    * it allows capture of ASIO sound devices, which are often professional or semi-professional grade hardware for studio or home-studio use.
    * The plugin is designed for Windows and has been tested on windows 11 x64.
